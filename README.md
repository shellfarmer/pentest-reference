* NOERROR - The zone is being served from the requested authority without issues.
* SERVFAIL - The name that was queried exists, but there's no data or invaid data for that name at the requested authority. 
* NXDOMAIN - The name in question does not exist, and therefore there is no authoritative DNS data to be served.
